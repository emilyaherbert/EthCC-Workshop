# Voting Contract

This contract will handle voting for the group's favorite numbers.

In order to best showcase the features of Sway during this workshop, we will be using test-driving-development using the Rust SDK. The Rust SDK is an SDK for Fuel that allows you to compile, deploy, and test Sway contracts, launch a local Fuel network, and more, in Rust. In this example, the Rust SDK was used to create [some initial testing](tests/harness.rs) that should help guide your implementation of the Sway contract.

The skeleton of the contract is written for you already, but you will be completing the body of it.

### Steps

1. Familiarize yourself with [the ABI](src/voting_library.sw) for the contract we will be writing

2. Familiarize yourself with [the error types](src/errors.sw) that we will be using in our contract 

3.
